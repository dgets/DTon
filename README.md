## A simple tone generator with high hopes and aspirations

I had originally started on a project called [MinTone](https://github.com/dgets/MinTone), which ended up coming along to a very functional point before some strange gradle and Android version/library horkage caused it to become unsalvagable, at least with my level of knowledge in Android Studio.

Not too long ago, I began missing having a portable application that could be used to generate arbitrary tones again.  So, after much stress trying to salvage _MinTone_, I decided to write a more updated version from the ground up.  Of course, I should be able to copy at least a large portion of the audio tone generation code.  The display and interface are going to be very different, however, in order to incorporate a greater amount of preset tone storage, and more advanced functionality after I get the basics working.  At some point hopefully this will include oscillation between different tones, and perhaps some sort of mixing, although I'm not sure if that is even going to be a feature that would have a real-world usage at this point.  I guess maybe it would, outside the realm of what I plan on utilizing this application for.

So here it is, and we're on the way to refreshing Android java coding skills and a fresh new tone generator application.
